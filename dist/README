SATIP-AXE firmware binary files
===============================

This directory contains USB and flash firmware for
  * Inverto IDL-400s
  * Grundig GSS.BOX
  * Telestar Digibit R1

Update:
-------

  - check differences in /etc/config.default against /etc/sysconfig/config
    - example: diff -u /etc/config.default /etc/sysconfig/config
  - since build 9 firmware upgrade may be upgraded using upgrade-fw tool
    - file can be fetched directly from github
    - or specified as a local firmware file directly
    - the file is copied to ramfs before flashing
    - the first attempt fails usually (ask Inverto), press Enter to repeat
    - example: 'upgrade-fw'
      - lists firmwares on github
    - example: 'upgrade-fw satip-axe-201504211434-8.fw'
      - fetches file from github and flashes it, but if the local
        file satip-axe-201504211434-8.fw exists, it is preferred

Installation:
-------------

  - set DHCP in the original firmware (not 100% required, but several
    users reported that without this change the network might not work)
  - setup a DHCP server for the box ethernet MAC address
  - copy satip-axe-$(VERSION).usb as idl4k.scr (rename the file) to the USB stick
  - copy satip-axe-$(VERSION).fw (no rename) to the USB stick
  - both files should be in the root directory on the USB stick
  - plug the USB stick to the upper USB port in box
  - turn on the box
  - the tuner LEDs must blink (Knight Rider effect) for few seconds
  - box is accessible through telnet or ssh, IP address is obtained using DHCP
  - the default login/password is root/satip
  - the firmware is not written to the internal flash - when the USB stick
    is not in the box, the original firmware will be booted

Installation to internal flash:
-------------------------------

  - WARNING! The original firmware will be deactivated!
  - the original firmware can be turned on using idl4k.recovery (see bellow)
  - same steps, but use satip-axe-$(VERSION).flash file as idl4k.scr
  - after boot of the new version, remove the USB stick to not write
    the .fw file multiple times to flash (on each box start); eventually
    the idl4k.scr file can be removed from the USB stick to prevent
    another reflash
  - the firmware is written to another internal flash area than
    the original firmware, but uboot is reconfigured

Customization:
--------------

  - configuration file is in /etc/sysconfig/config
  - put localtime file (glibc) to /etc/sysconfig/localtime
  - put resolv.conf file to /etc/sysconfig/resolv.conf
  - localboot script can be in /etc/sysconfig/localboot
  - passwd file is copied from /etc/sysconfig/passwd
  - ssh authorized_keys file is copied from /etc/sysconfig/authorized_keys
  - inetd.conf file is linked to /etc/sysconfig/inetd.conf
  - oscam configs are in /etc/sysconfig/oscam directory
  - if /etc/sysconfig/customd script exists, it is executed from init
  - if /etc/sysconfig/profile script exists, it is executed at login
  - writeable ftp - copy /etc/inetd.conf to /etc/sysconfig/inetd.conf and
    add -w argument to the ftpd daemon

httpd:
------

  - /media tree is exported

ftpd:
-----

  - /media tree is exported, use root/satip as login

nfsd:
-----

  - only v3 protocol is supported
  - to list connected clients 'showmount'
  - to list exports 'exportfs'

Minisatip config:
-----------------

  - you may add extra parameters to MINISATIP_OPTS= in /etc/sysconfig/config
  - WARNING: use -d with unique numbers if you have _multiple_ SAT>IP servers on net
  - SEE: minisatip.md file in this directory for more details
  - example 1: only two tuners: MINISATIP_OPTS="-e 0-1"
  - example 2: unicable: MINISATIP_OPTS="-u 0:1-1420,1:0-1210,2:2-1680,3:3-2040"
  - AXE hardware specific options:
     -L link adapters (identical src,lo/hi,h/v), the format is M:S (master:slave)
     -Q quattro LNB config (H/H,H/V,L/H,L/V)
     -X X AXE unicable/jess input (0-3)
  - example 3: unicable coax in input 2: MINISATIP_OPTS="-X 1"
  - example 4: quattro LNB: MINISATIP_OPTS="-Q"
  - example 5: coax in inputs 1,2, tuner 3 slave to input 1, tuner 4 slave to input 2
               MINISATIP_OPTS="-L 0:2,1:3"

OSCAM config:
-------------

  - in /etc/sysconfig/oscam directory
  - login/password is oscam/satip, http webui available at http://<boxip>:8888
  - use persistent serial device names (like /dev/ttyUSB1-1.2:1.0)
  - or use customized serial device names (see /etc/sysconfig/config)

Misc:
-----

  - full tuner reset - "axe-debug reset"

Recovery from the wrong configuration:
--------------------------------------

  - it works with firmware build 10 and later
  - for flashed firmware:
    - copy idl4k.cfgreset file as idl4k.scr file to the root directory on the USB stick
  - for firmware on the USB stick:
    - copy idl4k.cfgresetusb file as idl4k.scr file to the root directory on the USB stick
    - copy satip-axe-*.fw file as satip-axe.fw to the root directory on the USB stick
      (build 10 or later)
  - plug the USB stick to the upper USB port in box
  - turn on the box
  - the old configuration file is moved to /etc/sysconfig/config.old

Recovery of the original firmware:
----------------------------------

  - copy idl4k.recovery file as idl4k.scr file to the root directory on the USB stick
  - plug the USB stick to the upper USB port in box
  - turn on the box
  - box is accessible through http (web browser) - original firmware

Notes:
------

  - there is 128M SPI flash memory in the device
  - 128k for u-boot (probably)
  - 4M marked as system-nand0 (probably unused)
  - the original firmware uses fw1-nand0 flash region (32M)
  - the satip-axe firmware uses fw2-nand0 flash region (32M)
  - data block is named data-nand0 - uses rest of flash

Bugs:
-----

  - the Inverto driver do not initialize properly sometimes
    (minisatip is not started); if minisatip does not work,
    you may check 'logread' for tuner initialization error (512)
    or use 'dmesg' to check the lines bellow;
    turn off the box for 5-30 minutes and try again...
