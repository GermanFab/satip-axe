This directory contains USB firmware for
  * Inverto IDL-400s
  * Grundig GSS.BOX
  * Inverto IDL-400S

Installation:

  - setup a DHCP server for the box ethernet MAC address
  - copy satip-axe-$(VERSION).usb as idl4k.scr (rename the file) to the USB stick
  - copy satip-axe-$(VERSION).fw (no rename) to the USB stick
  - both files should be in the root directory on the USB stick
  - plug the USB stick to the upper USB port in box
  - turn on the box
  - the tuner LEDs must blink (Knight Rider effect) for few seconds
  - box is accessible through telnet or ssh, IP address is obtained using DHCP
  - the default login/password is root/satip
  - the firmware is not written to the internal flash - when the USB stick
    is not in the box, the original firmware will be booted

Installation to flash:

  - WARNING! The original firmware will be overwritten!
  - same steps, just replace satip-axe-$(VERSION).usb to satip-axe-$(VERSION).flash
  - after boot of the new version, remove the USB stick to not write
    the .fw file multiple times to flash (on each box start)

Customization:

  - configuration file is in /etc/sysconfig/config
  - localboot script can be in /etc/sysconfig/localboot
  - passwd file is copied from /etc/sysconfig/passwd
  - ssh authorized_keys file is copied from /etc/sysconfig/authorized_keys

Recovery of the original firmware:

  - copy idl4k.recovery file as idl4k.scr file to the root directory on the USB stick
  - plug the USB stick to the upper USB port in box
  - turn on the box
  - box is accessible through http (web browser) - original firmware

Notes:

  - there is 128M SPI flash memory in the device
  - 128k for u-boot (probably)
  - 4M marked as system-nand0 (probably unused)
  - the original firmware uses fw1-nand0 flash region (32M)
  - the satip-axe firmware uses fw2-nand0 flash region (32M)
  - data block is named data-nand0 - uses rest of flash

Bugs:

  - the Inverto driver do not initialize properly sometimes
    (minisatip is not started)
