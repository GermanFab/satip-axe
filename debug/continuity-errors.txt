A problem with the original firmware and satip-axe firmware is that
sometimes there are many continuity errors in the stream. Also, sometimes
the 8192 PID (means FULLMUX) does not work (bandwidth only few KB instead
megabytes).

The CC errors are visible using 'axe-debug pti vdev 0' or
'grep -v AAAAAAAAAAAA /proc/STAPI/stpti/PTI0/vDeviceInfo'.
The CC errors are not detected by the PTI interface when 8192 PID (fullmux)
is used.

So there is a data-loss somewhere between STV0900 (demux) and STx7018 (PTI).

The data-loss is visible more when multiple tuners are used together.

Possible steps:

- decode I2C communication with the demodulator
- try to inject I2C commands to STV0900
- write own axe-fe module ? because nothing else depends on it,
  it could be replaced, the only big thing is to determine the i2c
  connection to STx7018

Checking STV0900 registers:
