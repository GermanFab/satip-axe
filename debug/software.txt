TS flow
*******

main_axe.out binary initializes paths using STAPI from PTI to the dmxts interface
which provides buffers of size 2695168 bytes per queue.

Kernel modules
**************

Demodulators and LNB supply/DiseqC chips are driven from the axe-fe module
(which uses axe-i2c module doing the I2C I/O).

The frontend (probably only LED control ?through I2S bus?) is driven from
the axe-fp module.

The dmx module is not used but it works as a section decoder. Unfortunately,
there is no DVR module to collect output and to offer standard DVR API.
